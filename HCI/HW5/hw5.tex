\chapter*{A}

The design of the search interface is based on a mix between free-form and defined searching.  The user is able to search for a keyword or phrase in the database, or they can limit the search to a single category.  This allows a user to do complex searches without having to learn complicated search syntax and reduces the complexity of the program.  This can reduce the program's development time.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{The search window.}
\end{figure}

The user can enter the keyword they want to search for in the first textbox and then select which category they would like to search.  The default category ``Any'' searches the entire database.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\center{\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{ss2.png}}}
\caption{The category menu shows the top categories in the database.  The number of categories shown is set in the configuration menu.  The top categories are determined by the number of items in a category and how often that category is searched.  The user can type in any category they want to search.}
\end{figure}

\chapter*{}

To run a search, the user enters the term or phrase to search, then selects the search category, and then presses the search button.  To speed up entry input, the user can hit the tab key to switch to the next control.  Pressing enter will run the search without having to click on the search button.  The user can use the up and down keys to cycle through the list of categories or they can type in the category they want to search.

\caption{The user inputs a search to determine the number of mops in the office.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{The search returns two entries for mop.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{We see that the clinic has two good mops and one broken one.}
\end{figure}

\chapter*{}

The database search is carried out by converting the users search input into a SQL query.  By using categories, we can reduce the number of results returned to the user.  This makes reading the results easier for the user.  The search is done case-insensitive, and the keyword is searched against the item name, item description, item ID, and the faulty description.  For example, the search for mop in the sample images could possibly produce the following SQL:

\lstset{language=SQL}
\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT *
FROM "items"
WHERE ( "name" LIKE "mop" OR "description" LIKE "mop" OR 
    "id" LIKE "mop" OR "fault" LIKE "mop") 
    AND "category" LIKE "office supplies"
\end{lstlisting}
