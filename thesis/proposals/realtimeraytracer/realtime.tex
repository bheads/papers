\section{Real-time}
I am proposing to implement a real-time ray tracer.  I will research algorithms and data structures to reduce the ray tracer run time.  I will research techniques of CPU parallelism for algorithms and data structures.  I believe it is possible to reduce the algorithms runtime with either parallel ray casting or parallel collision detection.

Much of the research in real-time ray tracing is concentrated around fast ray-object collision testing.  One of the simplest ways to speed this up is by reducing the number of collision tests\cite{kd:2005}.
Much of this research is about parallel kd-trees and octrees on the GPUs\cite{kd:2007}\cite{fkd:2007}.  I believe much of this research can be applied to real-time ray tracing\cite{kd:2006}.

K-d trees, octrees and other data structures can be used to reduce the number of collision tests by dividing the game world in to smaller, searchable regions.  I will be investigating several different data structures in order to achieve real-time results.
