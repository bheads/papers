\section{ Introduction }

Computer graphics has push the need for faster hardware,  and more efficient algorithms and data structures.  Producing life-like computer-generated images,  computer interfaces, computer-aided design in manufacturing, a multi-billion dollar game industry, and life-like CGI movies\cite{gaming:2007} has made computer graphics an important field of study.

There are two dominant rendering algorithms in computer graphics.  The most widely used algorithm is the z-buffer, which is based upon sorting triangles in a depth buffer.  The other algorithm is ray casting that is based on the physics of light.  Both algorithms are commonly used today, but often for different purposes.
