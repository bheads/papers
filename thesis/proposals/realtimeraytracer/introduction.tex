\section{ Introduction }

Computer graphics has push the need for faster hardware,  and more efficient algorithms and data structures.  Producing life-like computer-generated images, computer interfaces, computer-aided design in manufacturing, a multi-billion dollar game industry, and life-like CGI or computer generated image movies\cite{gaming:2007} has made computer graphics an important field of study.

There are two dominant rendering algorithms in computer graphics.  The most widely used algorithm is the z-buffer, which is based upon sorting triangles in a depth buffer.  The other algorithm is ray casting which is based on the physics of light.  Both algorithms are commonly used today, but often for different purposes.

I am proposing to study and develop a real-time ray tracer.  My research will focus on combining parallelism and data partitioning.  Currently, research in ray tracing has been focusing off loading computation onto graphics cards and multiple machines over a network.  I will concentrate on data structure design with parallelism.  Part of the research will be to determine the complexity of the runtime of different data structures to find an optimal design.
