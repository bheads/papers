\opening{Dear Hiring Manager}

I saw you posting for an Associate Game Developer on your web site.  I see this as a great opportunity to get an entry-level position into an industry I love.  As a Michigan native and an avid gamer, Stardock is on the top of my list of developers to work for.

Enclosed is a copy of my resume containing my education and experience, but you will find it lacks the ability to truly define my passion for creating games.  Video games are a medium with an infinite amount of expression and challenge all aspects of programming.  It is in this industry that I find my fulfilment as a programmer.



\closing{Sincerely,}
